We explore the problem of modeling computer programs to infer their properties. We argue that programs can be modeled as Markov Random Fields, where the latent random variable is the property of interest. We approximate inference over such a graphical model via graph neural networks (GNN), a neural network architecture which captures graph-like structural information. As a case study, we work on the problem of inferring variable types in programs. We show that modeling this task using GNNs provides a 10-15\% improvement in accuracy in type prediction, when compared to a bi-directional RNN which uses token information. Via an ablation study, we also investigate aspects affecting a GNN's performance in such a modeling task.
