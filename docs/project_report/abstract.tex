We explore the problem of modeling computer programs to infer their properties.
We argue that programs can be modeled as Markov Random Fields, where the latent random variables in the graph represent the properties of interest.
We approximate inference over such a graphical model via graph neural networks (GNN), a neural network architecture which captures graph-like structural information.
As a case study, we work on the problem of inferring variable types in JavaScript programs.
We show that modeling this task using GNNs provides a 10-15\% improvement in accuracy of type prediction when compared to a bi-directional RNN baseline.
Via ablation studies, we also investigate the benefits of various modeling assumptions we make in our GNN construction.
