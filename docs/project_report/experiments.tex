\section{Experiments}
\label{sec:experiments}
In this work, we investigate the following research questions
\begin{itemize}
	\item How
	\item How
	\item Do features selected by models trained on complex representations provide a rich qualitative understanding?
\end{itemize}

We built a balanced set of roughly $66$k functions and used blah blah

The dataset pertaining to each label was split into a training and test set in the ratio $66\%$-$33\%$. The dataset for each label was balanced - with roughly the same number of positive and negative samples, and stratified to ensure that the distribution of function types was similar in the train and test set. 

Our models
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt]
	\item \textbf{Model1, \progname{Tr}.} Oh boy.
	
	\item \textbf{Model2, \TokNoOp.} We use 
	
\end{itemize}

For models trained on our representations, we also analyze the highest contributing features. These two analyses help answer the three research questions we pose.
