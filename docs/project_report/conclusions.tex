\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusions}

Our results demonstrate that for learning tasks on graph-based structures, the inductive bias introduced by GNNs offers a significant benefit over other modeling choices.
For the specific task of type prediction on our dataset, we show that GNNs perform better than state of the art modeling choices like bi-directional RNNs.
We also confirm through experiments that the right choice of edges in the graph has a significant effect on the performance of the learning task.
Despite these results, we have not yet validated one of our initial assumptions, that a graph neural net is actually approximating some underlying probabilistic graphical model.
We believe there is an important larger research question about how to formalize GNNs through the lens of probabilistic graphical models.
Theoretically and experimentally proving (or disproving) their correspondence is an open question, and would provide much deeper insight into these results.
