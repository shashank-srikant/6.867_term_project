\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusions}

In this work, we investigate modeling computer programs using graph neural networks. Our results demonstrate that for learning tasks on graph-based structures, the inductive bias introduced by GNNs offers a significant benefit over other modeling choices. For the specific task of type prediction, we show that GNNs perform better than state of the art modeling choices like bi-directional RNNs. We also confirm through experiments the effect the right choice of edge information has on the learning task. We believe a larger research question on formalizing GNNs through the lens of probabilistic graphical modes is wide open.
