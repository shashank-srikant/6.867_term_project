\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusions}

This work presents an important first step in applying GNNs to research problems in the PL community. Our results demonstrate that the inductive bias introduced by GNNs offers a significant benefit over other architectures and methods for structured inputs, such as source code graphs. For the task of type prediction, our GNN method performs better than all baselines and reduces the error of randomly guessing by half.
